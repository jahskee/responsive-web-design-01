                    Boracay's pristine beaches provide excellent sites and facilities for scuba diving. There are also
                    many scuba diving associations, the most notable is New Wave Divers. If you are not a veteran in
                    this activity, there are many resources, teams, and groups that can provide education from basic up
                    to advanced divers you will have a quick start and learn more from experience. For newbies, there
                    are formal diving classes offered by New Wave instructors, with a reasonable amount. They also
                    provide diving certifications and license. There are site wrecks that are home to different marine
                    mammals and sea creatures that you will be surprised to encounter. The marine life is enormous.
                    There many diving types of equipment for rent from around the town available on the island. For

                <p>
                    Tattoo shops, is everywhere in Boracay. Some you can find on the sidewalks, or if you want the
                    safest and quality artwork, I recommend professional artist such as "Art Tattoo Shop." It is located
                    within the perimeter of Bamboo Beach Hotel & Resorts in Station 3. The designs are numerous to
                    choose from, the one that fits your personality. They do services such as sketch something from your
                    likes and imagination. The art works are mostly generated from a vector graphics software. Before
                    the inking begins, the sketch will show you a glimpse of the art work. Then you are ready to go.

                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're not a fan of permament ink, there's an alternative, that is Henna tattoo. There are a
                    bunch of artists
                    around the are. This is much cheaper than having permanent ink if you just want a temporary tattoo.
                    But just be aware, some hotels prohibits Henna because it leaves a permanent ink or damage in their
                    linens and pillows.
                    The hotel charge fines if such things happen.

                <p>
                    Boracay Island offers a wide variety of food; you can get raw and fresh sea foods from the well
                    known wet market. A variety of fish such as grouper, salmon, seashells, oysters, tilapia, big
                    lobsters, crabs much cheaper than those you get from restaurants. If you are too busy with beach
                    activities and don't want to miss the fun, there are ready-to-eat food around every corner. One of
                    my favorites is Andoks Chicken Restaurant. It is open 24 hours, so you do not have to worry about
                    what time you will get your dinner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best part and my favorite, most hotels serve buffet for lunch and dinner. You get the chance to
                    be with people lining up for food and have some chit-chat, good chance you will meet interesting
                    people; The prices are not that high for around $5. Most of these buffet business provides unlimited
                    fruit punch or sodas. Don't miss the "pork lechon," that is served for limited customers, those that
                    check-in early in the buffet.

                <p>
                    Clubbing is one of the best you can get in Boracay. The party starts at 8 PM up to 2 AM in the
                    morning. Bring your love ones get some beer relax and just dance. It's either you stay on your table
                    relax and watch the crowd, or you can dive into the dance floor. It's easy to order a beer or some
                    french fries. Before the party begins, it's also a good activity to watch the sunset at Conga Bar
                    and get a hot milk with gelatine is my favorite. Club Paraw offers unlimited beer at a fixed price.
                    They also serve affordable finger food such as grilled pork, tasty calamari squid. Just be sure to
                    get in before 9 pm to avail the best seat in the club. The club also invites famous DJs and
                    celebrities to put on a great party. Be sure to be nice to your waiter they are quick at completing
                    your orders. Tips are optional, and they don't expect much. You might get surprised when someone
                    approaches and asks for your name especially when you're alone in the bar. So, it is an excellent
                    opportunity to meet new people.
